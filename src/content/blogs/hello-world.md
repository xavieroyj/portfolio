# Introduction
I'm Xavier, a student from SIT (Singapore Institute of Technology) studying Computing Science. I'm currently interning in Mediatek as an NPU physical implementation engineer. Concurrently, I'm also working on a bus chartering service called [Shiftbus](https://shiftbus.com) with a bunch of friends.

I'm currently learning about reverse engineering so you might see more blog post related to it soon.

# What to expect
Don't expect anything too interesting just yet. This blog would be a mixture of everyday life, technologies I'm currently learning, and other random thoughts.
